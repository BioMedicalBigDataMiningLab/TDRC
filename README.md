# Tensor Decomposition with Relational Constraints
This is our Python implementation for the unpublished paper.

# Introduction
Tensor Decomposition with Relational Constraints (TDRC) is a tensor decomposition method for predicting 
# Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.8. The required packages are as follows:
   * tensorly == 0.4.3
   * numpy == 1.16.4
# Arguments--
